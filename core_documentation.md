# Core Documentation

This document provides essential information about the project's core components, architecture, and implementation details.

## Project Overview
The AI Project Manager and Developer Coach is an intelligent agent designed to assist in the development of machine learning applications. It combines project management capabilities with code development assistance, providing a comprehensive solution for ML project development.

## Core Components

### Project Manager
- Manages project structure and organization
- Handles task scheduling and tracking
- Maintains project state and context
- Implements memory system for context awareness

### Memory System
- Short-term memory for current context
- Long-term memory for project history
- Vector database for semantic storage
- Context-aware message processing

### Vector Store
- Stores project documentation
- Enables semantic search
- Maintains code context
- Provides context-aware responses

### Tool System
- Extensible framework for development tasks
- Code generation and review
- Project structure management
- Real-time message processing

## Implementation Details

### Memory System
- Uses vector embeddings for semantic storage
- Implements context window management
- Maintains message history with context awareness
- Provides context-aware responses

### Vector Database
- Uses ChromaDB for semantic storage
- Implements semantic search capabilities
- Maintains document embeddings
- Provides context-aware retrieval

### Tool System
- Implements tool registry for extensibility
- Provides tool execution framework
- Maintains tool state and context
- Implements error handling and logging

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Maintain modular components
- Use clear, descriptive function names
- Document all public functions
