# MCP Access Implementation Task

## Objective

Implement an external MCP (Model Control Protocol) access layer for the BeeAI framework that enables seamless communication between external applications and the BeeAI system. This will allow external tools, agents, and systems to leverage BeeAI capabilities through standardized MCP endpoints.

## Background

The BeeAI Framework has recently completed its core FastMCP integration, which includes:

1. `BeeAIMCPServer` for exposing BeeAI components as MCP tools
2. `BeeAIMCPClient` for communicating with MCP servers
3. Adapters for middleware and workflow components

The next step is to create a secure, robust external access layer that exposes selected BeeAI functionality to external systems, prioritizing security, performance, and usability.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **External MCP Endpoint**
   - Create a public-facing MCP server that exposes selected BeeAI capabilities
   - Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Ensure secure communication through HTTPS/TLS

2. **Tool Registration System**
   - Create a configuration-driven tool registration system
   - Implement role-based access control for tools
   - Support versioning of exposed tools

3. **Client SDK**
   - Develop a simple Python client SDK for easy integration
   - Include examples for common use cases
   - Create comprehensive documentation with usage examples

### Technical Specifications

1. **Server Implementation**
   - Use FastAPI as the web framework for the MCP server
   - Implement connection pooling for optimal performance
   - Create proper logging and monitoring
   - Handle rate limiting and abuse prevention

2. **Tool Exposure**
   - Expose the following BeeAI components as MCP tools:
     - Sequential thinking capabilities
     - Context enhancement middleware
     - Vector memory operations
     - Workflow orchestration
     - Visualization services

3. **Authentication**
   - Implement API key authentication
   - Support OAuth 2.0 for advanced use cases
   - Create a user/app management system

4. **Monitoring**
   - Track tool usage and performance
   - Implement error reporting and diagnostics
   - Create dashboard for monitoring server health and usage

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: External AI Agent Using BeeAI Sequential Thinking

```python
from beeai_client import BeeAIClient

# Connect to BeeAI MCP server
client = BeeAIClient(
    url="https://beeai-mcp.example.com",
    api_key="your_api_key"
)

# Use sequential thinking to solve a problem
result = client.sequential_thinking.solve(
    problem="Design a user authentication system with two-factor authentication",
    steps=5,
    context={"domain": "web_security", "requirements": ["secure", "user-friendly"]}
)

# Access the reasoning steps
for step in result.reasoning_steps:
    print(f"Step {step.number}: {step.title}")
    print(step.content)
```

### Example 2: Using Vector Memory Operations

```python
from beeai_client import BeeAIClient

# Connect to BeeAI MCP server
client = BeeAIClient(
    url="https://beeai-mcp.example.com",
    api_key="your_api_key"
)

# Store information in vector memory
client.vector_memory.store(
    collection="project_docs",
    documents=[
        {"text": "Architecture overview...", "metadata": {"type": "architecture", "project": "beeai"}},
        {"text": "API documentation...", "metadata": {"type": "api_docs", "project": "beeai"}}
    ]
)

# Query vector memory
results = client.vector_memory.search(
    collection="project_docs",
    query="How is the middleware system structured?",
    filters={"project": "beeai"},
    limit=5
)

for result in results:
    print(f"Score: {result.score}, Text: {result.text[:100]}...")
```
