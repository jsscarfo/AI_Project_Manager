# Parallel Execution Controller Implementation Task

## Objective

Implement a robust Parallel Execution Controller for the BeeAI Framework that enables concurrent execution of multiple agents and tasks within the multi-agent workflow system. This will significantly enhance the framework's ability to orchestrate complex, distributed AI agent workflows with optimal performance.

## Background

The BeeAI Framework has successfully implemented:
1. Core middleware framework
2. Multi-agent workflow system with orchestration
3. Sequential thinking agent implementation
4. FastMCP integration

However, the current workflow system executes tasks sequentially, which limits throughput and efficiency. The Parallel Execution Controller will address this limitation by enabling concurrent execution while maintaining proper dependency management and state consistency.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements

1. **Parallel Task Execution**
   - Execute independent tasks concurrently
   - Maintain dependency resolution between tasks
   - Implement dynamic scaling of concurrent tasks based on system load

2. **Resource Management**
   - Implement rate limiting for external API calls (especially LLM providers)
   - Manage memory and CPU utilization
   - Support prioritization of critical tasks

3. **State Management**
   - Ensure thread-safe access to shared resources
   - Implement transaction-like semantics for workflow state updates
   - Support checkpointing and resumption of parallel workflows

4. **Error Handling and Recovery**
   - Gracefully handle failures in parallel tasks
   - Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Support partial workflow completion with detailed error reporting

### Technical Specifications

1. **Execution Engine**
   - Implement an asynchronous task scheduler using Python's asyncio
   - Create a worker pool for managing parallel execution
   - Develop a task queue system with priority support

2. **Integration Points**
   - Enhance WorkflowOrchestrator to support parallel execution
   - Modify AgentTask to include concurrency constraints
   - Update the communication protocol for parallel messaging

3. **Monitoring and Visualization**
   - Implement real-time monitoring of parallel execution
   - Create visualization tools for parallel task execution
   - Develop performance metrics collection for optimization

4. **Agent Adapters**
   - Ensure all agent implementations are thread-safe
   - Implement cooperative multitasking for resource-intensive agents
   - Create adapters for potential external agent systems

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Parallel Data Processing Workflow

```python
from beeai_framework.workflows import WorkflowOrchestrator, AgentTask
from beeai_framework.agents import DataProcessingAgent, AnalysisAgent, ReportAgent

# Create specialized agents
data_agent = DataProcessingAgent()
analysis_agent = AnalysisAgent()
report_agent = ReportAgent()

# Create orchestrator with parallel execution enabled
orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator(
    agents=[data_agent, analysis_agent, report_agent],
    parallel_execution=True,
    max_concurrent_tasks=10
)

# Define tasks with dependencies
data_tasks = []
for dataset in datasets:
    # These tasks can run in parallel
    data_tasks.append(AgentTask(
        id=f"process_data_{dataset.id}",
        agent_type="data_processing",
        data={"dataset": dataset.path},
        dependencies=[],
        concurrency_group="data_processing"  # For resource management
    ))

# Analysis tasks depend on data processing
analysis_tasks = []
for i, data_task in enumerate(data_tasks):
    analysis_tasks.append(AgentTask(
        id=f"analyze_data_{i}",
        agent_type="analysis",
        data={"analysis_type": "trend_detection"},
        dependencies=[data_task.id],
        concurrency_group="analysis"
    ))

# Report task depends on all analysis tasks
report_task = AgentTask(
    id="generate_report",
    agent_type="report",
    data={"report_type": "executive_summary"},
    dependencies=[task.id for task in analysis_tasks]
)

# Add all tasks to orchestrator
for task in data_tasks + analysis_tasks + [report_task]:
    orchestrator.add_task(task)

# Execute workflow with parallel execution
async def run_workflow():
    results = await orchestrator.execute_workflow()
    return results

# Process results
results = asyncio.run(run_workflow())
```

### Example 2: Dynamic Parallel Task Creation

```python
from beeai_framework.workflows import WorkflowOrchestrator, AgentTask
from beeai_framework.agents import PlannerAgent, ExecutorAgent

# Create agents
planner = PlannerAgent()
executor = ExecutorAgent()

# Create orchestrator with parallel execution
orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator(
    agents=[planner, executor],
    parallel_execution=True,
    dynamic_tasks=True  # Allow runtime task creation
)

# Initial planning task
planning_task = AgentTask(
    id="create_plan",
    agent_type="planner",
    data={"objective": "Build a recommendation system"}
)

# Add initial task
orchestrator.add_task(planning_task)

# Custom handler to create execution tasks based on planning output
@orchestrator.on_task_complete("create_plan")
def create_execution_tasks(task_result):
    execution_tasks = []
    for i, step in enumerate(task_result.plan.steps):
        # Create a task for each plan step
        execution_tasks.append(AgentTask(
            id=f"execute_step_{i}",
            agent_type="executor",
            data={"step": step},
            dependencies=[] if i == 0 else [f"execute_step_{i-1}"]
        ))
    
    # Add tasks to orchestrator at runtime
    for task in execution_tasks:
        orchestrator.add_task(task)

# Execute workflow with dynamic task creation
results = asyncio.run(orchestrator.execute_workflow())
```
