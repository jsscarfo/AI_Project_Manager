# Development Project Manager V5 (DPM)

## Project Overview

The Development Project Manager V5 (DPM) is an AI-assisted project management system designed to streamline software development workflows through intelligent automation, semantic understanding, and real-time collaboration. V5 represents a significant architectural evolution from previous versions, implementing a 100% Python codebase with a middleware-centric approach for enhanced modularity, extensibility, and maintainability.

The DPM V5 system provides advanced capabilities including:
- Middleware-based contextual enhancement
- Weaviate vector database integration for knowledge management
- Multi-model LLM orchestration with specialized routing
- Streamlined tool registry with middleware integration
- Real-time progress updates and collaboration
- Project management integration with enhanced visualization

## Architecture Overview

DPM V5 is built on a middleware-centric architecture implemented entirely in Python that enables flexibility and extensibility while maintaining robust integration between components.

### Core Components

1. **Middleware Framework**
   - Base middleware architecture with Python abstract base classes
   - Middleware registry and chain system
   - Standard interfaces for extensibility
   - Context passing and enhancement

2. **Vector Memory System**
   - Weaviate implementation as the sole vector database
   - Standardized VectorMemoryProvider abstract base class
   - Embedding generation service with multiple models
   - Context enhancement middleware

3. **LLM Provider System**
   - Multi-model orchestration and routing
   - Streaming support across all providers
   - Contextual enhancement via middleware
   - Cost optimization through intelligent model selection

4. **Tool Registry**
   - Dynamic tool registration and discovery
   - Tool-specific middleware enhancements
   - Parameter validation via middleware
   - Result caching and invalidation

5. **Orchestration Framework**
   - Task planning with sequential thinking
   - Parallel execution of independent tasks
   - Result quality evaluation
   - Output synthesis and summarization

6. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - MCP protocol integration via FastMCP
   - Detailed progress tracking
   - Support for partial results
   - Unified notification system

### System Workflow

The typical workflow in the DPM V5 system follows this sequence:

1. **Request Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   User Request → MCP Server → Middleware Chain → Tool Selection → Orchestration → Execution → Streaming Results
   ```

2. **Memory Architecture**
   ```
   Content/Request → Middleware Processing → Weaviate Storage → Semantic Retrieval → Context Enhancement → Response Generation
   ```

3. **Tool Ecosystem**
   ```
   Tool Definition → Tool Registry → Middleware Enhancement → Execution → Progress Tracking → Result Caching
   ```

## Development Phases

The development of DPM V5 will proceed in three phases:

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Implementation
- Middleware framework
- Vector memory middleware with Weaviate integration
- LLM provider system
- Basic MCP server using FastMCP

### Phase 2: Advanced Features Implementation
- Enhanced orchestration system
- Advanced semantic system
- Project management integration
- Extended tool ecosystem

### Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements
- Real-time collaboration improvements
- API enhancements and documentation
- Developer tools and visualization
- Performance optimization

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Middleware Development**
   - Create clear abstract base classes for each middleware type
   - Implement middleware chain with proper context passing
   - Design for testability with mock middleware
   - Ensure middleware can be composed and reordered

2. **Vector Provider Implementation**
   - Implement Weaviate provider as the sole vector database solution
   - Ensure provider follows VectorMemoryProvider abstract base class
   - Develop comprehensive tests using pytest
   - Implement optimized batch operations

3. **LLM Integration**
   - Create adapters for multiple LLM providers
   - Implement streaming for all supported providers
   - Develop router for model selection
   - Ensure middleware can enhance LLM context

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests for individual components using pytest
   - Integration tests for middleware chains
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Performance benchmarks for critical paths

## Development Guidelines

1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow middleware architecture with clear separation of concerns
   - Group related functionality by feature domain
   - Limit file size to 500 lines; refactor larger files
   - Use consistent Python naming conventions across all components

2. **Testing Approach**
   - Write unit tests for all middleware components using pytest
   - Create integration tests for middleware chains
   - Develop end-to-end tests for complete workflows
   - Benchmark performance for critical operations

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain comprehensive documentation in the `docs` folder
   - Use docstrings for all public functions and classes
   - Create diagrams for complex workflows
   - Document middleware interfaces and composition patterns

4. **Performance Considerations**
   - Implement caching at appropriate levels
   - Use vectorized operations where possible
   - Monitor and optimize memory usage, especially for vector storage
   - Profile middleware chains to identify bottlenecks
