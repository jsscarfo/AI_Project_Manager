# Project Management Integration Implementation Task

## Objective

Implement a robust Project Management Integration system for the BeeAI Framework that provides structured representation, tracking, and management of AI projects and their associated tasks, resources, and dependencies.

## Background

The BeeAI Framework has successfully implemented:
1. Core middleware framework with contextual enhancement
2. Multi-agent workflow system with orchestration

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Creating and Managing an AI Project

```python
from beeai_framework.project_management import ProjectManager, Project, Task

# Create project manager
manager = ProjectManager()

# Create a new project
project = Project(
    name="Customer Support AI",
    description="AI system to handle customer support requests",
    metadata={
        "domain": "customer_service",
        "priority": "high",
        "stakeholders": ["support_team", "product_team"]
    }
)

# Add to manager
project_id = manager.create_project(project)

# Create tasks for the project
tasks = [
    Task(
        name="Requirements Analysis",
        description="Analyze customer support requirements",
        estimated_duration={"days": 3},
        dependencies=[]
    ),
    Task(
        name="Dataset Preparation",
        description="Prepare training data from support tickets",
        estimated_duration={"days": 5},
        dependencies=["Requirements Analysis"]
    ),
    Task(
        name="Model Training",
        description="Train AI models on support data",
        estimated_duration={"days": 7},
        dependencies=["Dataset Preparation"]
    ),
    Task(
        name="Integration Testing",
        description="Test AI with support systems",
        estimated_duration={"days": 4},
        dependencies=["Model Training"]
    )
]

# Add tasks to project
for task in tasks:
    manager.add_task(project_id, task)

# Generate project timeline
timeline = manager.generate_timeline(project_id)

# Get project status
status = manager.get_project_status(project_id)
print(f"Project status: {status.completion_percentage}% complete")
print(f"Estimated completion date: {status.estimated_completion_date}")

# Update task status
manager.update_task_status(
    project_id=project_id,
    task_name="Requirements Analysis",
    status="completed",
    actual_duration={"days": 2}
)

# Regenerate timeline after update
updated_timeline = manager.generate_timeline(project_id)
```

### Example 2: Integrating Project Management with Workflows

```python
from beeai_framework.project_management import ProjectManager
from beeai_framework.workflows import WorkflowOrchestrator, AgentTask

# Create project manager and get project
manager = ProjectManager()
project_id = "customer_support_ai_123"
project = manager.get_project(project_id)

# Get current active task from project
task = manager.get_next_task(project_id)

# Create workflow orchestrator
orchestrator = WorkflowOrchestrator()

# Create agent task from project task
agent_task = AgentTask(
    id=f"task_{task.id}",
    agent_type="data_processing" if task.name == "Dataset Preparation" else "model_training",
    data={
        "project_context": project.metadata,
        "task_requirements": task.description,
        "resources": task.allocated_resources
    },
    dependencies=[]
)

# Add task to orchestrator
orchestrator.add_task(agent_task)

# Execute workflow
async def run_workflow():
    results = await orchestrator.execute_workflow()
    
    # Update project task with results
    manager.update_task(
        project_id=project_id,
        task_id=task.id,
        status="completed" if results.success else "failed",
        output=results.output,
        actual_duration=results.duration
    )
    
    return results

# Run workflow and update project
results = asyncio.run(run_workflow())

# Get updated project status
status = manager.get_project_status(project_id)
print(f"Project status after workflow: {status.completion_percentage}% complete")
```
