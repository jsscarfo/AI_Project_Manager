# Sequential Thinking Middleware for BeeAI Framework V5

## Overview

The Sequential Thinking Middleware is a sophisticated system designed to enable AI agents to perform step-by-step reasoning with contextual awareness. This middleware component supports complex problem-solving by breaking down tasks into discrete thinking steps, each enhanced with relevant context from the knowledge base.

## Core Philosophy

Sequential Thinking addresses fundamental limitations in LLM-based problem solving:

1. **Complex Problem Decomposition**: Breaking complex problems into manageable steps
2. **Progressive Context Refinement**: Providing the right context at each step in the reasoning process
3. **Reasoning Transparency**: Making the thinking process visible and analyzable
4. **Cognitive Efficiency**: Optimizing context usage for each reasoning step
5. **Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating relevant information at precisely the right moment

## Architecture

The Sequential Thinking Middleware is built on a modular architecture with several key components:

## Key Components

### 1. Sequential Thinking Processor

The `SequentialThinkingProcessor` is the core class responsible for managing the step-by-step reasoning process:

- **Thought Sequence Management**: Tracks the progression of thoughts through a reasoning task
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Allows for flexible adjustment of the reasoning path based on intermediate results
- **Process Orchestration**: Coordinates the flow between thinking steps and context retrieval
- **Error Handling**: Provides robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms

### 2. Context Refinement Processor

The `ContextRefinementProcessor` optimizes context for each reasoning step:

- **Context Selection**: Determines the most relevant context for each reasoning step
- **Quality Evaluation**: Assesses the relevance and utility of potential context
- **Context Window Optimization**: Manages token usage to maximize information value
- **Progressive Refinement**: Improves context selection based on the evolving reasoning process

### 3. Reasoning Trace System

The `ReasoningTraceSystem` provides transparency and analysis capabilities:

- **Trace Recording**: Captures the complete reasoning process with context used
- **Analysis Tools**: Evaluates reasoning quality and identifies patterns
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of reasoning flows
- **Serialization**: Supports exporting and sharing of reasoning traces

### 4. LLM Provider Adapters

The system includes adapters for multiple LLM providers:

- **Provider Abstraction**: Unified interface for different LLM services
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Automatic fallback between providers on failure
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time streaming of reasoning steps
- **Parameter Optimization**: Provider-specific parameter tuning

### 5. Context Templates

Pre-defined templates optimize context retrieval for different reasoning tasks:

- **Planning Templates**: For high-level planning and strategy development
- **Coding Templates**: Specialized for software development tasks
- **Debugging Templates**: Optimized for problem diagnosis and resolution
- **Research Templates**: For information gathering and synthesis tasks

## Integration with Knowledge Retrieval

The Sequential Thinking Middleware integrates closely with the Knowledge Retrieval system:

### SequentialThinkingKnowledgeRetriever

This specialized component bridges Sequential Thinking and Knowledge Retrieval:

- **Step-Specific Queries**: Extracts key concepts from each reasoning step
- **Relevance Boosting**: Prioritizes concepts mentioned in previous steps
- **Knowledge Hierarchy Navigation**: Selects appropriate knowledge levels (Domain, TechStack, Project)
- **Weighted Retrieval**: Balances different types of knowledge based on reasoning needs

### StepContextManager

Manages context throughout the reasoning process:

- **Context Tracking**: Maintains context state across reasoning steps
- **Transition Logic**: Handles the flow of context between steps
- **Window Management**: Optimizes context size for token limits
- **Context Caching**: Improves performance for frequently accessed information

### ReasoningFeedbackCollector

Collects and processes feedback to improve retrieval:

- **Implicit Feedback**: Analyzes concept usage in reasoning outputs
- **Explicit Feedback**: Processes direct feedback about context utility
- **Adaptive Tuning**: Adjusts retrieval parameters based on feedback
- **Quality Metrics**: Tracks context relevance and utility over time

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from beeai_framework.middleware.sequential_thinking import (
    SequentialThinkingProcessor,
    SequentialThought
)

# Initialize the processor
processor = SequentialThinkingProcessor()

# Process a task
result = await processor.process_task(
    "Design a system to optimize warehouse operations",
    max_steps=8,
    system_prompt="Focus on practical automation solutions"
)

# Access the complete reasoning trace
reasoning_trace = processor.get_reasoning_trace()

# Output the final result
print(result)
```

### Integration with Knowledge Retrieval

```python
from beeai_framework.middleware.sequential_thinking import SequentialThinkingProcessor
from beeai_framework.middleware.knowledge_retrieval import SequentialThinkingKnowledgeRetriever

# Initialize components
knowledge_retriever = SequentialThinkingKnowledgeRetriever(
    vector_provider=weaviate_provider,
    embedding_service=embedding_service
)

processor = SequentialThinkingProcessor(
    knowledge_retriever=knowledge_retriever,
    context_refinement=True
)

# Process task with knowledge enhancement
result = await processor.process_task(
    "Refactor the authentication system to use JWT",
    task_type="code_implementation",
    knowledge_levels=["techstack", "project"]
)
```

### Context Templates

```python
from beeai_framework.middleware.sequential_thinking import (
    SequentialThinkingProcessor,
    context_templates
)

# Use a predefined coding template
coding_template = context_templates.get_template("coding")

# Customize template parameters
coding_template.set_parameters(
    language="python",
    framework="fastapi",
    include_examples=True
)

# Process with the template
processor = SequentialThinkingProcessor(context_template=coding_template)
result = await processor.process_task("Implement a user registration endpoint")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizing Latency

The system is designed with performance in mind:

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: All operations are asynchronous to maintain responsiveness
2. **Context Caching**: Frequently used context is cached to reduce retrieval time
3. **Batch Operations**: Embeddings and retrievals are batched where possible
4. **Progressive Loading**: Critical context is loaded first, with supplementary context added as needed

### Context Window Management

To optimize context window usage:

1. **Relevance Scoring**: Only the most relevant context is included
2. **Compression Techniques**: Context is summarized where appropriate
3. **Progressive Refinement**: Context precision increases with each step
4. **Token Budgeting**: Available tokens are allocated based on reasoning needs

## Integration with BeeAI Framework

The Sequential Thinking Middleware is integrated with the BeeAI Framework through:

1. **Middleware Chain**: Registered in the middleware chain for automatic processing
2. **Configuration System**: Configurable through the framework's configuration
3. **Knowledge Graph**: Connected to the Weaviate-based knowledge system
