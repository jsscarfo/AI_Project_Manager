### Reasoning Quality Metrics

A comprehensive metrics system that evaluates reasoning quality:

- **Consistency Metrics**: Measure logical consistency across reasoning steps
- **Relevance Scores**: Evaluate how relevant each reasoning step is to the overall goal
- **Completeness Analysis**: Assess whether reasoning covers all necessary aspects
- **Error Detection**: Identify logical fallacies or inconsistencies in reasoning
- **Confidence Calibration**: Evaluate how well confidence predictions match actual performance

### Context Usage Analytics

Tools for analyzing how context is used throughout the reasoning process:

- **Context Utilization Heatmaps**: Visual representation of context usage intensity
- **Retrieval Effectiveness**: Metrics on how effectively retrieved context is utilized
- **Token Efficiency**: Analysis of token usage relative to reasoning quality
- **Context Type Analysis**: Breakdown of different types of context used in reasoning

### Evaluation Dashboard

A unified dashboard for visualizing:

- **Real-time Performance**: Current metrics and benchmarks
- **Historical Trends**: Performance changes over time
- **Comparative Views**: Side-by-side comparison of different strategies
- **Anomaly Detection**: Highlighting unusual patterns in reasoning or metrics
- **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporating human feedback into evaluations

### A/B Testing Framework

A comprehensive framework for comparing different reasoning and retrieval strategies:

- **Test Case Management**: Define and organize test cases with specific inputs and expected outputs
- **Strategy Configuration**: Configure different strategies with specific parameters
- **Test Execution**: Run tests across strategies with controlled environments
- **Statistical Analysis**: Apply statistical methods to determine significant differences
- **Visualization**: Generate comparative visualizations of test results
- **Export/Import**: Save and load test configurations and results

## Integration with BeeAI Framework

The visualization and evaluation tools integrate with several key components:

1. **Sequential Thinking Middleware**: Captures reasoning traces for visualization
2. **Knowledge Retrieval System**: Monitors retrieval effectiveness
3. **LLM Provider System**: Tracks performance across different models
4. **Multi-Agent Workflow System**: Visualizes workflows and agent interactions

## Usage Example

```python
from beeai_framework.visualization import VisualizationService
from beeai_framework.evaluation.ab_testing import ABTestFramework, TestCase, TestStrategy

# Create visualization service
vis_service = VisualizationService()

# Create test strategies
strategy_a = TestStrategy(
    name="baseline",
    parameters={
        "retrieval_method": "vector_search",
        "model": "gpt-4"
    }
)

strategy_b = TestStrategy(
    name="enhanced",
    parameters={
        "retrieval_method": "hybrid_search",
        "model": "gpt-4"
    }
)

# Define test cases
test_cases = [
    TestCase(
        id="case1",
        input="Analyze the requirements for a user authentication system",
        expected_output="Authentication system analysis with security considerations",
        metrics=["relevance", "completeness", "consistency"]
    )
]

# Create A/B test framework
ab_framework = ABTestFramework()

# Run comparative test
results = ab_framework.run_comparative_test(
    test_cases=test_cases,
    strategies=[strategy_a, strategy_b]
)

# Analyze results
analysis = ab_framework.analyze_results(results)

# Visualize results using the visualization service
vis_service.visualize_ab_test_results(
    results=results,
    metrics=["relevance", "completeness", "consistency"],
    output_path="comparison_results.html"
)

# Visualize a specific reasoning trace
vis_service.visualize_reasoning_trace(
    trace=results[0]["traces"][0],
    highlight_context_usage=True,
    output_path="reasoning_trace.html"
)

# Visualize context usage
vis_service.visualize_context_usage(
    trace=results[0]["traces"][0],
    output_path="context_usage.html"
)

# Visualize metrics for a specific result
vis_service.visualize_metrics(
    metrics_data=analysis["metrics"],
    output_path="quality_metrics.html"
)

# Export visualization data for later use
vis_service.export_visualization_data(
    data=results,
    output_path="visualization_data.json"
)
```
