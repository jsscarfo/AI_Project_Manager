### Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each visualization component is self-contained and can be used independently or in combination with others.

2. **Extensibility**: The system is designed to be easily extended with new visualization components or metrics.

3. **Interoperability**: Components follow consistent interfaces and data models for seamless integration.

4. **Performance**: Visualizations are optimized for handling large traces and complex analysis.

5. **Usability**: High-level APIs make it easy to create visualizations without detailed configuration.

### Data Flow

1. **Input**: Reasoning traces from the Sequential Thinking system.
2. **Processing**: Analysis by various metrics and visualization components.
3. **Output**: Interactive visualizations, metrics, and reports.
