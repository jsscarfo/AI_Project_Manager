# Visualization Framework Examples

This directory contains examples demonstrating how to use the reasoning trace visualization framework.

## Examples

### Simple Example

`simple_example.py` - A simplified example that demonstrates the metrics visualization data format without requiring the full visualization module to be installed. This example:

1. Creates sample steps and context sources
2. Generates time series, radar chart, and heatmap data
3. Combines them into a metrics visualization dataset
4. Saves the data to JSON format in the output directory

Example output:
```
=== Simple Metrics Visualization Example ===

Metrics Summary:
  step_count: 7
  total_time: 38.65
  avg_time_per_step: 5.52
  context_references: 10

Saved metrics data to output/metrics_example.json
```

### Complete Example

`trace_visualization_example.py` - A more comprehensive example that demonstrates all aspects of the visualization framework, including:

- Step visualization
- Context source visualization
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Metrics visualization

**Note:** This example requires the full visualization module to be properly installed as a Python package.

## Integration with Web Visualization

The visualization data generated by these examples is designed to be consumed by the web-based trace viewer located in the `V5/web/trace_viewer` directory. The JSON files produced by these examples can be loaded into the web viewer for interactive visualization.
